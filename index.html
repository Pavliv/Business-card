				<p>They have at least one singular characteristic. It has been observed that most birds of prey look back over their shoulders before striking prey (or shortly thereafter); predation is after all a two-edged sword. All hawks seem to have this habit, from the smallest kestrel to the largest Ferruginous - but not the Eagles.</p>

					<h4><span class="numberadm">&#10102;</span> food</h4>
					<p>Sea eagles or fish eagles take fish as a large part of their diets, either fresh or as carrion. Snake or serpent eagles are, as the name suggests, adapted to hunting reptiles.</p>
					<h4><span class="numberadm">&#10103;</span> high speed</h4>
					<p>There are cases where an eagle in flight speed reached 130 km/h. Even the smallest eagles have relatively long and wide wings, and capable of rapid flight.</p>
					<h4><span class="numberadm">&#10104;</span> keen eyesight</h4>
					<p>They have extremely keen eyesight that allows them to find prey at a distance. This vision eagles are primarily due to the extremely large pupils which ensure minimal diffraction of light.</p>
					<h4><span class="numberadm">&#10105;</span> nidification</h4>
					<p>Over the years, Eagle Nest increases and can reach 2 meters tall and weigh 1 ton. Eagles build their nests in tall trees or on high cliffs.</p>

			<h2>Etymology</h2>
			<div class="line"></div>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="etm_position">
					<div class="first">
						<img src="images/etymology.jpg">
						<h3 class="etm_h3">The modern English term for the bird is derived from Latin: aquila by way of French: aigle.</h3>
						<p class="etm_p">The origin of aquila is unknown, but it is believed to possibly derive from either aquilus (meaning dark-colored, swarthy, or blackish) as a reference to the plumage of eagles or from aquilo (meaning north wind).</p>
					</div>
					<div class="second">
						<h3 class="etm_h3">Old English used the term earn, related to Scandinavia's ørn/örn. It is similar to other Indo-European terms for "bird" or "eagle", including Greek: ὄρνις (ornís), and Welsh: eryr.</h3>
						<p class="etm_p">In Britain before 1678, eagle referred specifically to the golden eagle, with the other native species, the white-tailed eagle, being known as erne. The modern name "golden eagle" for aquila chrysaetos was introduced by the naturalist John Ray.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="third">
						<h3 class="etm_h3">Religion and folklore</h3>
						<p class="etm_p">The Moche people of ancient Peru worshiped the eagle and often depicted eagles in their art.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="fourth">
						<h3 class="etm_h3">Ancient writers such as Lucan and Pliny the Elder claimed that the eagle was able to look directly at the sun, and that they forced their fledglings to do the same. Those that blinked would be cast from the nest. This belief persisted until the Medieval era.</h3>
						<p class="etm_p">The eagle is the patron animal of the ancient Greek god Zeus. In particular, Zeus was said to have taken the form of an eagle in order to abduct Ganymede, and there are numerous artistic depictions of the eagle Zeus bearing Ganymede aloft, from Classical times up to the present (see illustrations in the Ganymede (mythology) page.)</p>
